# Gesture Volume Control

## Overview
Gesture Volume Control is a Python-based project that utilizes MediaPipe for hand tracking to control the system volume using simple hand gestures. The tip of the index finger and thumb are detected, and the distance between them is used to adjust the volume level. A visual volume bar is also displayed to track the changes in real time.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Volume control based on the distance between the index finger and thumb
- Visual representation of the volume level
- Smooth and responsive user experience

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-volume-control.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gesture-volume-control
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to start the gesture volume control:
```bash
python gesture_volume_control.py
```

## How It Works
1. The script captures video from the webcam.
2. MediaPipe detects the hand and tracks the landmarks.
3. The distance between the index finger tip and thumb tip is calculated.
4. The volume level is adjusted based on the calculated distance.
5. A volume bar visually represents the current volume level.
